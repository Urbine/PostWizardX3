PostWizardX3 is a comprehensive content management system built for WordPress, with a focus on WordPress-based content publishing. It provides an end-to-end automation pipeline for **content optimization and workflow orchestration**, while demonstrating architectural patterns broadly applicable to automation-heavy publishing systems.

PostWizardX3 was designed to operate alongside [PostWizardREST](https://github.com/Urbine/PostWizardREST) as a client-side automation and machine-learning layer, delegating high-throughput persistence, validation, and security-sensitive operations to a dedicated backend service.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a modular, automation-first approach to managing WordPress-based publishing pipelines.

### What This Project Demonstrates

* End-to-end content automation workflows for WordPress sites
* Modular, bot-driven architectures for distinct content types
* Practical application of NLP-based classification in publishing pipelines
* Multi-source content ingestion and normalization
* Integration patterns for third-party APIs
* Configuration-driven extensibility with minimal hardcoding

### Original Context

PostWizardX3 was originally built as an internal tool for managing high-volume, automated content publishing. While the original product and service are no longer active, the engineering work remains valuable as:

* A **reference implementation** for automation-heavy publishing systems
* A **learning resource** for complex workflow orchestration
* A **production-grade example** of architectural and integration patterns
* A **foundation** for experimentation or adaptation

## TL;DR

* 🏛️ Archived project, not actively maintained
* 🧠 Complete automation and ML-driven publishing system
* 🧩 Modular, bot-based architecture
* ⚠️ Requires updates for production use
* ❌ No guaranteed maintenance or support


## 🌟 Detailed Features

### 🤖 Machine Learning Classification

* Ensemble-based text classification using:

  * NLTK Naive Bayes
  * NLTK Maximum Entropy
  * Scikit-learn Multinomial Naive Bayes (TF-IDF)
* Category, tag, and description-based predictions
* Designed for large-scale, semi-automated publishing workflows
* Supports retraining using corrected classifications

### 📝 Content Management

* WordPress REST API integration with authentication handling
* Local caching for efficient synchronization
* Automated category, tag, and media management
* SQLite-based repositories for ingestion and staging

### 🎬 Specialized Content Workflows

The system includes multiple **bot-style workflows**, each implementing a shared interface:

* Video content automation
* Photo gallery automation
* Embed-based publishing
* Database synchronization and updates

These workflows are intended to demonstrate architectural and orchestration patterns rather than serve as polished end-user tools.

### 🌐 External Integrations

* WordPress REST API
* Social platforms (X/Twitter, Telegram)
* Search APIs (multiple providers)
* Third-party media provider feeds

### 🔧 Configuration & Administration

* Interactive Gradio-based configuration interfaces
* File-based configuration and secrets management
* Support for multiple authentication and API key types

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Architectural Patterns

* **Factory Pattern** — configuration object creation
* **MVC-inspired separation** — models, controllers, and Gradio-based views
* **Strategy Pattern** — interchangeable automation workflows
* **Adapter Pattern** — unified interfaces over third-party APIs
* **Builder Pattern** — request and payload construction

## 🧠 Machine Learning System (Implementation Notes)

The ML engine uses cached WordPress content as training data to build classifiers that predict appropriate categories and tags.

* Tokenization and preprocessing via NLTK
* Multiple classifiers trained per feature type
* Serialized models stored locally and loaded at runtime
* Designed for retraining as category schemes evolve
