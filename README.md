## 📌 Project Overview

PostWizardX3 is a comprehensive content management system designed for WordPress, with a focus on adult content websites. It provides a complete pipeline for:
**adult-oriented, age-restricted affiliate content**, the architectural patterns are broadly
applicable to automation-heavy publishing systems.

### What This Project Demonstrates

- End-to-end content automation workflows for WordPress-based sites
- Modular, bot-driven architectures for different content types
- Practical use of NLP-based classification in publishing pipelines
- Multi-source content ingestion and normalization
- Integration patterns for third-party APIs
- Configuration-driven extensibility with minimal hardcoding

### Original Context

This project was originally built as an internal tool for managing high-volume, automated
content publishing. The original product and service are no longer active, but the engineering
work remains valuable as:

- A **reference implementation** for similar automation systems
- A **learning resource** for complex workflow orchestration
- A **production-grade system** demonstrating architectural and integration patterns
- A **foundation** for experimentation or adaptation

---

## TL;DR

- 🏛️ Archived project, not currently maintained
- 🧠 Complete automation + ML-driven publishing system
- 🧩 Modular, bot-based architecture
- ⚠️ Requires updates for production use
- ❌ No guaranteed maintenance

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🤖 Machine Learning Classification

- Ensemble-based text classification using:
  - NLTK Naive Bayes
  - NLTK Maximum Entropy
  - Scikit-learn Multinomial Naive Bayes (TF-IDF)
- Category, tag, and description-based predictions
- Designed for large-scale, semi-automated publishing workflows
- Supports retraining using corrected classifications

### 📝 Content Management

- WordPress REST API integration with authentication handling
- Local caching for efficient synchronization
- Automated category, tag, and media management
- SQLite-based content repositories for ingestion and staging

### 🎬 Specialized Content Workflows

The system includes multiple **bot-style workflows**, each implementing a common interface:

- Video content automation
- Photo gallery automation
- Embed-based publishing
- Database synchronization and updating

These workflows are intended to demonstrate architectural and orchestration patterns rather
than serve as polished end-user tools.

### 🌐 External Integrations

- WordPress REST API
- Social platforms (X/Twitter, Telegram)
- Search APIs (multiple providers)
- Adult content provider feeds

### 🔧 Configuration & Administration

- Interactive Gradio-based configuration UIs
- File-based configuration and secrets management
- Support for multiple authentication and API key types

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Architectural Patterns

- **Factory Pattern** — configuration object creation
- **MVC-inspired separation** — models, controllers, and Gradio-based views
- **Strategy Pattern** — interchangeable content bot workflows
- **Adapter Pattern** — unified interfaces over third-party APIs
- **Builder Pattern** — payload and request construction

## 🧠 Machine Learning System (Implementation Notes)

The ML engine uses cached WordPress content as training data to build classifiers that predict
appropriate categories and tags.

- Tokenization and preprocessing via NLTK
- Multiple classifiers trained per feature type
- Serialized models stored locally and loaded at runtime
- Designed for retraining as category schemes evolve

## 🚀 Usage & Workflows

> ⚠️ **Note**
>
> The workflows in this repository are preserved for demonstration and experimentation purposes.
> Running them against live sites or third-party services requires careful review, appropriate
> credentials, and compliance with platform terms.

Implementation details, configuration UIs, and workflow entry points are preserved in the
repository for reference, but they are not organized as a step-by-step setup guide and may
require adaptation for modern environments.
