workflows package
=================

The essence of software packages is the ability to automate with the combination of libraries
and tasks that take care of portions of work. In this sense, the crucial part to understanding the role of
workflows is thinking about them as orchestration artifacts.

.. tip::
   Before going all in here, take a look at the documentation for the
